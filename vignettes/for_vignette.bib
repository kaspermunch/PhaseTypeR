abstract = {Probability modelling for DNA sequence evolution is well established and provides a rich framework for understanding genetic variation between samples of individuals from one or more populations. We show that both classical and more recent models for coalescence (with or without recombination)can be described in terms of the so-called phase-type theory, where complicated and tedious calculations are circumvented by the use of matrix manipulations. The application of phase-type theory in population genetics consists of describing the biological system as a Markov model by appropriately setting up a state space and calculating the corresponding intensity and reward matrices. Formulae of interest are then expressed in terms of these aforementioned matrices. We illustrate this procedure by a number of examples: (a)Calculating the mean, (co)variance and even higher order moments of the site frequency spectrum in multiple merger coalescent models, (b)Analysing a sample of DNA sequences from the Atlantic Cod using the Beta-coalescent, and (c)Determining the correlation of the number of segregating sites for multiple samples in the two-locus ancestral recombination graph. We believe that phase-type theory has great potential as a tool for analysing probability models in population genetics. The compact matrix notation is useful for clarification of current models, and in particular their formal manipulation and calculations, but also for further development or extensions.},

title = "Order statistics and multivariate discrete phase-type distributions.",
abstract = "In this thesis, we present three different topics of research which are related to the theory of phase-type distributions. Those topics are explained next. The Ô¨Årst research work is on order statistics from matrix-geometric distributions in the case of a sample of independent and non-identically distributed random variables. We prove that order statistics from matrix-geometric distributions are matrix-geometric distributed and we provide representations for their distributions. The second research work is a study of the discrete version of multivariate phasetype distributions introduced by V. G. Kulkarni. We give an expression for the joint probability-generating function in the similar way than in the continuous time case and under this base we make an analysis of this class of distributions and present examples that are commonly found in the literature. The third research work presented came out with the aim of relating the last two topics. That is, we found a problem which relates the concept of order statistics and multivariate phase-type distributions introduced by V. G. Kulkarni, the last in the case of continuous time. Thus, we present a research on concomitants of phase-type distributions. We provide a procedure to calculate the density function of concomitants of phase-type distributions and we prove that concomitants of phase-type distributions are phase-type distributed.",
